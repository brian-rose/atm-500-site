### Grading and course requirements


### Textbook (required):
Geoffrey K. Vallis (2006): *Atmospheric and Oceanic Fluid Dynamics*, Cambridge University Press.

### Other useful books:
- Holton and Hakim (2013): *An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology (5th ed.)*, Elsevier Academic Press.
- Benoit Cushman-Roisin (1994): *Introduction to Geophysical Fluid Dynamics*, Prentice Hall.
- John Marshall and R. Alan Plumb (2007): *Atmosphere, Ocean and Climate Dynamics: an introductory text*, Elsevier Academic Press.
- Joseph Pedlosky (1987): *Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (2nd ed.)*, Springer.
- Jonathan E. Martin (2006): *Mid-Latitude Atmospheric Dynamics: a first course*, John Wiley and Sons.

### Homework policy
There will be quasi-weekly homework assignments throughout the semester (about 10 total). Homework will be due **at the beginning of class** on the stated due date, usually 1 week after it is handed out. LATE HOMEWORK will incur a penalty of 15% per day. Exception: each student is granted ONE freebee late day to be used on one assignment of their choice. For these purposes “days” are defined as 24 hour periods after the due date and time, which is 10:15 am. Late assignments will not be accepted after solutions have been discussed in class.


### Academic integrity
We strive for an atmosphere of open inquiry and mutual respect. Class discussion in encouraged. Some collaboration and discussion with classmates on homework exercises is permissible, and sometimes even a good idea. However you must always submit your own work and your own thoughts, and give proper credit to others for previous work and ideas. It is every student’s responsibility to become familiar with the standards of academic integrity at UAlbany. Claims of ignorance, of unintentional error, or of academic or personal pressures are not sufficient reasons for violations of academic integrity. Please review these policies in the Graduate Bulletin at <http://www.albany.edu/graduatebulletin/requirements_degree.htm>
